# EDA BMI Case Study
Understand the given data and find the key insides of the data. 

## Create a Data Frame based on the input
data= { 'price':[
23, 30, 20, 27, 44, 26, 35, 20, 29, 29,
25, 15, 18, 27, 19, 22, 12, 26, 34, 15,
27, 35, 26, 43, 35, 14, 24, 12, 23, 31,
40, 35, 38, 57, 22, 42, 24, 21, 27, 33

## Questions 
Q1 - Compute the mean, median and the mode of the data

Q2. Compute the range, variance and standard deviation of Price

Q3. Find the mean deviation for the data.

Q4. Calculate the Pearson coefficient of skewness and comment on the skewness of the data

Q5. Count the number of data values that fall within one standard deviation of the mean.(Compare this with the answer from Chebyshev’s Theorem.)

Q6. Find the three quartiles and the interquartile range (IQR).

Q7. Are there any outliers in the data set ?

Q8. Draw a boxplot of the dataset to confirm.

Q9. Find the percentile rank of the datapoint 25.0.

Q10. What is the probability that a shirt cost(price) is above 25 dollars?

Q11. Create a frequency distribution for the data and visualize it appropriately

Q12. Create a probability distribution of the data and visualize it appropriately.

Q13. What is the shape of the distribution of this dataset?
Create an appropriate graph to determine that. Take 100 random samples with replacement from this dataset of size 5 each. Create a sampling distribution of the mean age of customers. Compare with other sampling distributions of sample size 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. State your observations. Does it corroborate the Central Limit Theorem?

Q14. Treat this dataset as a binomial distribution where p is the probability that a shirt costs above 25 dollars. What is the probability that out of a random sample of 10 shirts 7 are costing more than 25 dollars

Q15. NuCloth Claims that 60% of all shirts in their website cost less than 25 dollars . Using the Normal approximation of a Binomial distribution, find the probability that in a random sample of 10 shirts 7 of them will cost less than 25 dollars.
[ Note that the normal distribution can be used to approximate a binomial distribution if np>=5 and nq>=5 with the following correction for continuity P(X=z) = P(z-0.5 < X < z+0.5 ) ]
Q16. Compute a 95% Confidence Interval for the true price of a shirt in the NuCloth website using appropriate distribution. ( State reasons as to why did you use a z or t distribution)

Q17. A data scientist wants to estimate with 95% confidence the true proportion of shirts having price greater than 25 dollars in the NuCloth website. A recent study showed that 60% of all shirts have a price greater than 25 dollars. The data scientist wants to be accurate within 2% of the true proportion. Find the minimum sample size necessary.

Q18. The same data scientist wants to estimate the true proportion of shirts having price greater than 25 dollars. She wants to be 90% confident and accurate within 5% of true proportion. Find the minimum sample size necessary.

Q19. NuCloth claims that currently 80% of all shirts have prices greater than 25 dollars . Test this claim with an alpha =0.05 if out of a random sample of 30 shirts only 23 are having prices above 25 dollars.

Q20. A data scientist is researching the hypothesis that the average price of a shirt in NuCloth is higher than the supermarket. So he collects data from NuCloth and the supermarket that the average shirt price of shirts in NuCloth is 36 dollars vs 34 dollars in the supermarket. The standard deviations are 7.6 and 5.8 respectively.Suppose the data scientist got these values after randomly selecting 100 shirts from each place.
        a. What hypothesis would he use to compare the shirt prices of NuCloth vs Supermarket
        b. What are critical values to be used?
        c. What statistical test will be used to compare these prices?
        d. Complete the test and obtain the P-value.
        e. Summarize his conclusion based on the P-value
